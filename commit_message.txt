Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(genes): Add GeneMarkS gene prediction results

Added gene prediction results from GeneMarkS. This is the fourth pipeline stage -
identifying protein-coding genes from assembled contigs. Started by committing the
main output file which contains gene coordinates and prediction metadata. GeneMarkS
is specialized for prokaryotic gene prediction and is ideal for metagenomic data.

Files created:
- Results/gmhmmp.20240724.053709.682348.gmhmmp.out.txt: GeneMarkS output with coordinates

Verified: Gene prediction completed successfully with high-confidence predictions.
