Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(taxonomy): Add MetaPhlAn taxonomic profiling - tabular output

Added taxonomic profiling results from MetaPhlAn analysis. This is the second pipeline
stage - determining what organisms are present in the metagenomic sample. MetaPhlAn
identifies microbial taxa and their relative abundances using marker genes. Started
with the standard tabular output format which is the primary MetaPhlAn output.

Files created:
- Results/metaphlan_result.tabular: Taxonomic composition in tabular format

Verified: Taxonomic composition successfully identified with abundance estimates.
