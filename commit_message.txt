Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(taxonomy): Export MetaPhlAn results to Excel format for easier viewing

Converted taxonomic profiling results to Excel format for easier viewing and sharing.
After generating the tabular results, exported them to Excel format for collaborators
who prefer spreadsheet tools over plain text tables. This improves accessibility of
the taxonomic composition data.

Files created:
- Results/metaphlan.xlsx: Taxonomic composition in Excel format

Verified: Excel format correctly represents the tabular data with proper formatting.
