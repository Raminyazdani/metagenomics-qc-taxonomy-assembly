Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(docs): Fix: correct data file path in README

HOTFIX: Corrected the data file path error from the previous commit. When verifying
the documented path, realized that data/sequences/ doesn't exist - the file is
directly under data/. Changed from data/sequences/ERR688365.fastq to the correct
data/ERR688365.fastq. Also improved the documentation by adding a reference to
LARGE_FILES.md which contains the actual access link.

Files modified:
- README.md: Corrected data file path and added LARGE_FILES.md reference

Verified: Path now correctly points to data/ERR688365.fastq as documented in LARGE_FILES.md.
