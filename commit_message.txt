Added gene and protein sequence files from GeneMarkS output. After the initial run
completed, added the sequence files (nucleotide and amino acid). These are needed
for downstream functional annotation via BLAST. Committing them separately makes
sense as they're distinct outputs serving different purposes - nucleotides for gene
analysis and amino acids for protein function annotation.

Files created:
- Results/gmhmmp.20240724.053709.682348.gmhmmp.out.fnn.txt: Predicted genes (nucleotide)
- Results/gmhmmp.20240724.053709.682348.gmhmmp.out.faa.txt: Predicted proteins (amino acid)

Verified: Sequence files contain valid FASTA-formatted predictions ready for BLAST.
