Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(qc): Add FastQC quality control results

Added quality control results from FastQC analysis of metagenomic sequencing data.
This is the first pipeline stage - quality control must pass before proceeding with
downstream analysis. FastQC assessed read quality, GC content, sequence duplication,
and potential contamination of the ERR688365.fastq sample.

Files created:
- Results/FastQC_on_data_1__Webpage.zip: FastQC HTML report with quality metrics

Verified: QC passed, reads are suitable for downstream metagenomic analysis.
