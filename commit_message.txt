Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(docs): Update README with data file information

Updated README to document the input data location. Attempted to improve documentation
by adding information about where the input sequencing data is located. This helps
users understand the data dependencies and how to obtain the required input files.

OOPS: Made a typo in the directory path - typed data/sequences/ERR688365.fastq
instead of the correct data/ERR688365.fastq. Added an extra subdirectory that
doesn't actually exist in the repository structure.

Files modified:
- README.md: Added data file location (with incorrect path)

Note: This error will be fixed in the next commit.
