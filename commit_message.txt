Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(portfolio): Portfolio ready: remove academic traces, professional documentation

Final portfolio transformation to remove all academic traces and reframe as professional
bioinformatics project suitable for portfolio display. Removed all academic context
markers ("University Project", assignment language) and converted to professional
active voice throughout. Emphasized practical reproducibility and real-world application
while maintaining scientific accuracy. Made it clear this is a results repository with
example outputs. Added comprehensive citations respecting tool authors.

Key changes:
- Removed "University Project" label from README
- Rewrote with professional active voice and framing
- Enhanced with comprehensive system requirements, prerequisites, and citations
- Reorganized into portfolio-appropriate sections
- Clarified pre-generated results nature (not runnable scripts)
- Added license section and tool acknowledgments
- Completed all tracking files (report.md, suggestion.txt, suggestions_done.txt)

Files modified:
- README.md: Complete professional overhaul
- report.md: Completed portfolio readiness tracking
- suggestion.txt: All issues documented and marked APPLIED
- suggestions_done.txt: All changes logged with before/after snippets

Verified: Repository is now portfolio-ready with no academic traces remaining.
