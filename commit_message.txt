Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(assembly): Add MEGAHIT de novo assembly results

Added de novo assembly results from MEGAHIT. This is the third pipeline stage -
reconstructing longer genomic sequences (contigs) from short sequencing reads.
Assembly is critical for downstream gene prediction and annotation. MEGAHIT is
optimized for metagenome assembly and the run completed successfully after several
hours of computation.

Files created:
- Results/megahit_result.fasta: Assembled contigs

Verified: Assembly produced high-quality contigs suitable for gene prediction.
