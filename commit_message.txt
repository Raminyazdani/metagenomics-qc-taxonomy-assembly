Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(annotation): Prepare representative sequences for BLAST analysis

Prepared representative sequences for functional annotation via BLAST. Selected
a representative subset of predicted genes to query against protein databases.
Not all genes need to be BLASTed due to computational cost and time constraints -
selected representative sequences covering diverse gene families for efficient
functional characterization.

Files created:
- Results/blastx_inputs.fasta: Selected sequences for BLAST functional annotation

Verified: Input sequences properly formatted and ready for BLAST queries.
