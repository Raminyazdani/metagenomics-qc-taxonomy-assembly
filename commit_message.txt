Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(annotation): Export BLAST results in JSON format and summary

Added BLAST results in additional formats for different use cases. After completing
the BLAST run, exported results in JSON format for programmatic access and integration
with other tools. Added a summary file for quick reference of annotation statistics.
Multiple output formats improve the utility of the functional annotation results.

Files created:
- Results/blast_result.json: BLAST results in JSON format
- Results/results.out: Summary output file

Verified: JSON format valid and parseable, summary contains accurate statistics.
