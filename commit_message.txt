Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(config): Add .gitignore and document large file storage approach

Added essential repository configuration to handle large bioinformatics data files.
The .gitignore ensures large sequencing files (220 MB) won't be accidentally committed
to Git. LARGE_FILES.md documents the external storage approach and provides access
instructions for the input sequencing data.

Files created:
- .gitignore: Ignore large data files (FASTQ) and temporary files
- LARGE_FILES.md: Document external data storage approach

Verified: Configuration files in place, large file handling documented.
