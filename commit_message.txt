Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(final): Final completion: add commit messages and verify repository integrity

Final completion step performing end-to-end quality pass and repository verification.
This step adds commit_message.txt files to all previous historian steps (step_01 through
step_17) and performs comprehensive verification of the portfolio-ready repository.

Changes made in this final step:

1. Added commit_message.txt to all 17 previous historian steps
   - Each commit message follows the required format:
     Line 1: "Ramin Yazdani | PROJECT_NAME | BRANCH | TYPE(SCOPE): SUMMARY"
   - Used "WIP" for intermediate/incomplete steps
   - Used "feat" for meaningful feature completions
   - Each includes detailed long message describing what changed, why, and verification

2. Fixed .gitignore configuration
   - Added pattern "~$*" to exclude Microsoft Office temporary files
   - Prevents Word temp files (like ~$report.docx) from being committed

3. Comprehensive verification performed:
   - ✅ All portfolio deliverables present and complete
   - ✅ All 12 result files verified with correct formats
   - ✅ Documentation accuracy verified (README, LARGE_FILES.md)
   - ✅ All paths use relative references
   - ✅ No broken documentation links
   - ✅ Historian steps 01-17 all have commit messages
   - ✅ No history/ or .git/ recursion in any snapshot

Verification approach:
As this is a results-only bioinformatics repository with no executable code,
verification focused on ensuring all result files are present, properly
documented, and accessible. No build/test steps are applicable.

Files modified:
- .gitignore: Added pattern for Office temp files
- history/steps/step_01 through step_17: Added commit_message.txt to each

Verified: Repository is fully working as a results-only portfolio project with
complete historian documentation. All 18 steps now have proper commit messages
following the required format. Final snapshot matches working tree exactly
(excluding history/).
