Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | feat(annotation): Add BLAST functional annotation results

Added BLAST functional annotation results. This is the fifth pipeline stage -
identifying protein homologs and assigning functions to predicted genes. BLAST
searches against the NCBI nr database identify similar proteins with known functions.
Started with standard tabular output formats which are most commonly used for
downstream analysis. BLAST queries took several hours to complete.

Files created:
- Results/blastx_results.txt: BLASTX results in tabular format
- Results/blast_result.txt: Alternative BLAST output format

Verified: BLAST completed successfully with functional annotations for query sequences.
