Ramin Yazdani | Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline | main | WIP(portfolio): Add professional project identity and portfolio tracking

Preparing repository for portfolio use. Established professional project identity
separate from the README to define display title, tagline, stack, and problem/approach.
Created systematic tracking files to document the transformation from research project
to portfolio piece. These files enable transparent tracking of all changes made during
portfolio preparation.

Files created:
- project_identity.md: Professional project framing
- report.md: Portfolio readiness tracking report
- suggestion.txt: Issue tracking ledger (TAB-separated format)
- suggestions_done.txt: Change tracking ledger with before/after snippets

Verified: Portfolio tracking infrastructure in place for systematic transformation.
