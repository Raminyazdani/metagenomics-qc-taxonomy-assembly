# Metagenomics Pipeline Analysis

**Project Type:** University Project

This repository contains analysis of metagenomic sequencing data.

## Project Overview

Metagenomic analysis pipeline for processing sequencing reads through quality control, taxonomic profiling, assembly, gene prediction, and functional annotation.

## Data Files

Input data is located at: `data/sequences/ERR688365.fastq` (WRONG PATH - actual is `data/ERR688365.fastq`)

## Results

All analysis results are in the `Results/` directory.
