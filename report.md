# Portfolio Readiness Report

## Project: metagenomics-qc-taxonomy-assembly

### Phase 0: Initial Setup ✅
- Created report.md (this file)
- Created suggestion.txt (issue ledger)
- Created suggestions_done.txt (change ledger)
- Created project_identity.md (professional project identity)

### Phase 1: Project Understanding ✅

**Repository Type:** Results-only repository containing metagenomic analysis outputs

**Current Structure:**
- README.md with pipeline documentation
- Results/ folder with analysis outputs (FastQC, MetaPhlAn, MEGAHIT, GeneMarkS, BLAST)
- report.docx (Word document with project report)
- LARGE_FILES.md (documents external data file location)
- No implementation scripts/notebooks present

**Project Domain:**
- Metagenomics bioinformatics pipeline
- Processes sequencing data through QC → taxonomic profiling → assembly → gene prediction → functional annotation
- Uses standard tools: FastQC, MetaPhlAn, MEGAHIT, GeneMarkS, BLAST+

**Professional Identity (defined in project_identity.md):**
- Title: Metagenomics QC-Taxonomy-Assembly Pipeline
- Slug: metagenomics-qc-taxonomy-assembly
- Tagline: End-to-end metagenomic sequencing analysis pipeline
- Stack: Bioinformatics tools (FastQC, MetaPhlAn, MEGAHIT, GeneMarkS, BLAST+)

### Phase 2: Pre-Change Audit ✅

**Scan Results:**

1. **Academic Traces Found:**
   - README.md line 3: "**Project Type:** University Project" ← MUST REMOVE

2. **Absolute Paths:**
   - ✅ None found (all paths are relative or documented as external)

3. **Naming Issues:**
   - ✅ Folder/file names are appropriate (Results/, README.md, etc.)
   - ✅ No assignment-style naming detected

4. **Documentation Issues:**
   - README presents repo as if it contains runnable scripts, but it's results-only
   - README tone is somewhat academic/passive
   - Need to clarify that results are pre-generated
   - Need to align README with professional identity

**Summary:**
- Primary issue: "University Project" label
- Secondary: README documentation needs professional reframing
- No code to refactor (results-only repository)
- No absolute paths to fix
- No structural reorganization needed

All findings documented in suggestion.txt with 8 entries.

### Phase 3: Portfolio-Readiness Changes ✅

**Changes Applied:**

1. **README.md - Complete Professional Overhaul:**

## Phase 6: Step-Expanded Git Historian (v2 - Current Run)

### Expansion Mandate

The repository was previously processed with an 11-step Git historian. This run expands the historian to meet the 1.5× multiplier requirement.

### Step Count Analysis

**Previous run:**
- N_old = 11 steps (step_01 through step_11)

**Current run:**
- N_target = ceil(11 × 1.5) = 17 steps (minimum required)
- N_achieved = 17 steps (step_01 through step_17)
- **Achieved multiplier: 1.55× ✅ (exceeds 1.5× requirement)**

### Expansion Strategies Applied

**Strategy A - Split Large Commits (4 instances):**

1. **Old step 01 → New steps 01-02:**
   - Step 01: Initial README only
   - Step 02: Add .gitignore and LARGE_FILES.md
   - *Rationale:* Separate content creation from configuration files

2. **Old step 03 → New steps 04-05:**
   - Step 04: MetaPhlAn tabular output first
   - Step 05: Add Excel format conversion
   - *Rationale:* Natural progression - standard output first, then formatted version

3. **Old step 05 → New steps 07-08:**
   - Step 07: GeneMarkS main prediction file
   - Step 08: Add nucleotide and amino acid sequence files
   - *Rationale:* Logical split - predictions first, then sequence extractions

4. **Old step 07 → New steps 10-11:**
   - Step 10: Initial BLAST results (tabular + txt)
   - Step 11: Add JSON format and summary file
   - *Rationale:* Separate primary results from additional export formats

**Strategy B - Insert "Oops → Hotfix" Sequence (1 pair):**

- **New step 12 (OOPS):**
  - **What broke:** Updated README but typed wrong data file path
  - **Mistake:** Documented path as `data/sequences/ERR688365.fastq` instead of `data/ERR688365.fastq`
  - **Plausibility:** Common directory structure typo, adds non-existent subdirectory

- **New step 13 (HOTFIX):**
  - **How noticed:** Tried to verify the documented path and realized the `sequences/` subdirectory doesn't exist
  - **What fixed:** Corrected to `data/ERR688365.fastq` and added reference to LARGE_FILES.md
  - **Timeline:** Same day as the oops, immediate correction

**Important:** The oops→hotfix pair exists only in the intermediate history (steps 12-13). The final snapshot (step_17) is correct and matches the current working tree exactly.

### Verification Results

**✅ Snapshot Integrity Checks:**
```bash
# Verified step_17 matches current working tree (excluding history/)
diff -r --exclude=".git" --exclude="history" . history/steps/step_17/
# Result: No differences (exit code 0)

# Verified no snapshots contain .git or history directories
for i in {01..17}; do 
  if [ -d "history/steps/step_$i/.git" ] || [ -d "history/steps/step_$i/history" ]; then 
    echo "FAIL: step_$i contains .git or history"
  fi
done
# Result: Check complete - no failures
```

**✅ Portfolio Deliverables (Re-verified):**
- ✅ project_identity.md - exists and complete
- ✅ README.md - portfolio-grade quality maintained
- ✅ report.md - exists (this file)
- ✅ suggestion.txt - all entries have STATUS=APPLIED
- ✅ suggestions_done.txt - all changes logged with before/after

**✅ Historian Deliverables:**
- ✅ history/github_steps.md - created with expansion note, step descriptions, and oops→hotfix details
- ✅ history/steps/step_01 through step_17 - all created (17 snapshots)
- ✅ All snapshots are FULL snapshots (not diffs)
- ✅ All snapshots exclude history/ directory
- ✅ All snapshots exclude .git/ directory
- ✅ Step 17 matches final working tree exactly (verified byte-for-byte)

### Mapping: Old Steps → New Steps

| Old Steps | New Steps | Change Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Old 01 | New 01-02 | Split: README then config files |
| Old 02 | New 03 | FastQC results (unchanged) |
| Old 03 | New 04-05 | Split: tabular then Excel format |
| Old 04 | New 06 | MEGAHIT assembly (unchanged) |
| Old 05 | New 07-08 | Split: predictions then sequences |
| Old 06 | New 09 | BLAST prep (unchanged) |
| Old 07 | New 10-11 | Split: results then export formats |
| *NEW* | New 12-13 | **Oops→Hotfix: wrong path then corrected** |
| Old 08 | New 14 | Comprehensive report (unchanged) |
| Old 09 | New 15 | Documentation enhancement (unchanged) |
| Old 10 | New 16 | Portfolio identity files (unchanged) |
| Old 11 | New 17 | Final portfolio state (unchanged) |

for i in $(seq -w 1 17); do 
  if [ -d "history/steps/step_$i/.git" ] || [ -d "history/steps/step_$i/history" ]; then 
    echo "FAIL: step_$i contains .git or history"
  fi
done
echo "All snapshots clean"

# Result: All snapshots clean
```

**5. Step Count Verification:**
```bash
# Previous run: 11 steps
ls -d history/_previous_run/steps/step_* | wc -l
